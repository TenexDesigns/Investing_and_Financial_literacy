Assets that can appreciate with inflation are those that tend to increase in value when the general price level in an economy is increasing. Here are some examples:

1. Real Estate: Property often appreciates in value during inflationary periods. As the cost of materials and labor increase, so does the value of property. Investing in real estate can be done through buying property directly or through Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).

2. Stocks: Companies can often pass on increased costs to consumers, which can lead to increased profits and higher stock prices. Investing in stocks can be done through a brokerage account.

3. Commodities: The price of commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products often increase with inflation. These can be invested in through commodity ETFs or futures contracts.

4. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS): These are government bonds that adjust with inflation. The principal of a TIPS increases with inflation, protecting the investor from losing purchasing power.

5. Inflation-Indexed Bonds: Similar to TIPS, these bonds increase their payout with inflation. They can be purchased directly or through bond funds.

To get started investing in these assets, here are some steps:

1. Set Clear Goals: Understand why you are investing. Is it for retirement, to buy a house, or for another goal? Your investment strategy should align with your financial goals.

2. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: All investments come with risk. You need to understand how much risk you are willing to take on. Generally, the higher the potential return, the higher the risk.

3. Research: Learn about different investment options and how they work. Understand the pros and cons of each.

4. Start Small: Especially if you're new to investing, start with a small amount that you can afford to lose. As you gain experience and confidence, you can start investing more.

5. Diversify: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.

6. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you're unsure about how to start investing, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

Remember, investing involves risk and it's possible to lose money. Always do your own research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
