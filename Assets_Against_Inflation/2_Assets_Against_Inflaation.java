Examples of assets that can appreciate with inflation include:

* **Real estate:** Real estate prices tend to rise over time, and they are often seen as a hedge against inflation. This is because the value of real estate is based on the underlying asset, which is land, which is a finite resource.
* **Commodities:** Commodities are raw materials that are used to produce goods and services. Commodities prices tend to rise during periods of inflation, as businesses and consumers are willing to pay more for these essential goods.
* **Stocks:** Stocks of companies that produce goods and services that are in high demand during periods of inflation tend to perform well. This is because these companies can pass on the higher costs of inflation to their customers.
* **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS):** TIPS are bonds issued by the US government that are indexed to inflation. This means that the principal value of the bond and the interest payments increase with inflation.

To get started in investing in assets that can appreciate with inflation, you can open a brokerage account and start buying stocks, bonds, or other assets. You can also invest in real estate by buying a rental property or investing in a real estate investment trust (REIT).

Here are some tips for investing in assets that can appreciate with inflation:

* **Do your research.** Before you invest in any asset, it is important to do your research and understand the risks and potential rewards.
* **Diversify your portfolio.** Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, invest in a variety of different assets to reduce your risk.
* **Invest for the long term.** Inflation is a long-term trend, so it is important to invest for the long term to reap the benefits.

It is also important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. Inflation can be volatile, and the prices of assets can go down as well as up. Therefore, it is important to invest carefully and to manage your risk.

If you are new to investing, it is a good idea to talk to a financial advisor who can help you create an investment plan that is right for you.
