Banks in the USA are typically owned by shareholders, which can include individual investors, institutional investors, and sometimes even the bank's employees. These banks can be publicly traded on stock exchanges, meaning their shares are available for purchase by the general public. As a result, profits from these banks are distributed to their shareholders, who can include anyone who holds their stock.

Here are some key points regarding ownership, profits, and trading of banks in the USA:

1. **Ownership:**
   - Many banks in the USA are structured as corporations. This means they have shareholders who own shares of the company. Shareholders are essentially owners of the bank and have a claim on the bank's assets and earnings.
   - Shareholders can include individuals, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional investors.

2. **Profits Distribution:**
   - Banks generate revenue through various activities such as lending, fees, investments, and more.
   - After deducting operating expenses, provisions for bad loans, and taxes, the remaining profit is typically distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.
   - Dividends are cash payments made to shareholders on a regular basis, usually quarterly.

3. **Publicly Traded Banks:**
   - Many banks in the USA are publicly traded companies, meaning their shares are listed on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ.
   - Investors can buy and sell shares of publicly traded banks through brokerage accounts.
   - Banks that are publicly traded have to adhere to regulatory requirements and provide financial disclosures to the public.

4. **Private Banks:**
   - Some banks are privately owned, meaning their shares are not publicly traded. Private banks might be owned by a limited group of investors, a family, or a consortium of investors.
   - Private banks have more flexibility in terms of operations and reporting since they are not subject to the same level of public scrutiny as publicly traded banks.

It's important to note that the ownership structure and regulations can vary among different banks, and changes can occur over time. Additionally, while profits are distributed to shareholders, banks also reinvest a portion of their profits back into the business for growth, technology, and other operational needs.

If you're interested in specific details about a particular bank or banks, their ownership structure, financial performance, and other relevant information, you would need to research their financial reports, stock market information, and official statements.
