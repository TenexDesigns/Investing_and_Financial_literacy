------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rapid increase in the money supply, as indicated by the printing of a substantial amount of money in a short period, can have several implications for the economy. In the case of the United States, the significant expansion of the money supply during this time frame can have the following effects:

1. **Inflationary Pressure**: When a large amount of money is injected into the economy, it can lead to inflationary pressure. Inflation occurs when there is an increase in the general price level of goods and services. The more money there is in circulation, the higher the demand for goods and services, which can drive up prices.

2. **Weakened Currency**: An increase in the money supply can lead to a devaluation of the currency, making each unit of currency worth less. A weaker currency can have implications for international trade and investment.

3. **Asset Price Inflation**: The excess money supply can flow into financial markets, driving up asset prices, including stocks, real estate, and commodities. This can lead to asset bubbles and increase wealth inequality as those with assets benefit the most.

4. **Savings Erosion**: High inflation can erode the real value of savings and fixed-income investments, impacting individuals on fixed incomes and retirees.

5. **Uncertainty and Volatility**: Rapid money supply expansion can create economic uncertainty and financial market volatility. Businesses and individuals may struggle to make long-term financial plans in such an environment.

6. **Central Bank Policies**: The central bank (the Federal Reserve, in the case of the United States) may need to respond by raising interest rates or employing other monetary policy tools to control inflation. Tightening monetary policy can have consequences for borrowing costs, economic growth, and investment.

7. **Global Impact**: Since the U.S. dollar is a global reserve currency, actions taken by the U.S. can have far-reaching effects on other countries' economies and financial markets.

8. **Debt Management**: A large increase in the money supply can impact the cost of servicing government debt. It might make it easier for the government to service its debt, but it can also raise concerns about the sustainability of debt levels.

Its important to note that the specific impact of an increase in the money supply can vary depending on various factors, including the overall economic conditions, the velocity of money (how quickly it circulates in the economy), and the public's expectations. While moderate increases in the money supply can be necessary to support economic growth, excessive or unchecked increases can lead to the negative consequences mentioned above.
  Central banks typically aim to strike a balance between maintaining price stability and supporting economic growth when managing the money supply.




HERE IS THE STUDY
=-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Estimates suggest that there's around $40 trillion in physical money (narrow money) circulating worldwide today. If you add "broad money," like cash in bank accounts, demand deposits, mutual funds, and securities, this amount could increase to around $90.4 trillion [Source 1](https://moneytransfers.com/bank-transfers/how-much-money-is-in-circulation).

Calculating the exact percentage of money printed in the last 5 years is complex due to several factors including the destruction of old notes, changes in demand for physical money, and the increase in digital transactions. However, a notable case is the United States, where it was reported that nearly 80% of all US dollars in existence were printed from January 2020 to November 2021 [Source 24](https://thewashingtonstandard.com/80-of-all-us-dollars-in-existence-have-been-printed-in-just-the-past-two-years/). 

Keep in mind that these figures are estimates and the actual amounts can vary. The amount of money in circulation is continually changing due to factors like economic policies, inflation rates, and changes in the global economy.
